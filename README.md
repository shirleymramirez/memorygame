This is a memory game that will let the user select the same tile color. 

User can click on one tile and it will reveal a random color between red, green, yellow or green. 

Once two tiles has been clicked with unmatched colors, it has 1 second then those tiles will be unselected again. 

Selected match tiles will remain until all tiles are matched. 

Header will be changed to "You Win!" once all matching tiles has been found and a restart button will be available as well.

This is made using React.js.
